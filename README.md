**Orb** is a new kind of observability platform that helps operators, developers, and end users understand their
networks, distributed applications, and traffic flows in real time.

**Orb** combines concepts from Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Compute, and high throughput stream processing to offer command
of a fleet of distributed agents which can be orchestrated in real time to summarize high volume, information dense data
streams down to lightweight, actionable business intelligence directly at the edge.

**Orb** gives you a precision instrument to collect just the observability data you are interested in, extracting the
needles from the haystack at the edge. It is based on the [pktvisor](https://github.com/ns1/pktvisor) observability
agent.

The platform is open source, extensible, vendor neutral, and cloud native.

**Orb** is a new project and just gathering speed. Star the project to show your interest! See more at [getorb.io](https://getorb.io) or [the Wiki](https://github.com/ns1labs/orb/wiki).

We are very interested in hearing about your use cases, feature requests, and other feedback.
